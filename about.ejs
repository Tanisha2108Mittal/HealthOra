    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p>
      Food is meant to nourish, comfort, and connect us. But for millions of people living with
      allergies or intolerances, every bite comes with hesitation. A simple grocery run turns into
      a marathon of scanning labels, decoding ingredients, and worrying about what might be hidden
      inside.
    </p>
    <p>
      We asked ourselves a simple question: <em>“What if shopping for food could be stress-free,
      transparent, and safe for everyone?”</em><br>
      That’s how Healthora was born.
